- Allow using real TCP sockets and also websockify bridge.
- Check mmap and in general persisted files, we should aim for same persistence as in tor.
- Check for memory leaks inside worker.
- Improve scheduling, probably need to call loop manually, perhaps based on number of sockets? Would it work to just disable execution and resume later?
